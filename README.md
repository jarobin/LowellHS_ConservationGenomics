# Lowell High School Conservation Genomics Workshop
Example files and questions so you can explore genetic data yourself.


1. SampleReads.fastq

  - What is a FASTQ file?
  - How many reads are in the file?


2. SampleAlignment.sam

  - What is a SAM file?
  - What is the location of the first read?


3. SampleGenotypes.vcf

  - What is a VCF file?
  - How many samples are in the file?
  - What is the reference allele in the first position? What is the alternate allele?


4. SampleGenotypes.vcf_AnnotationSummary.html

 Go to: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jarobin/LowellHS_ConservationGenomics/blob/master/SampleGenotypes.vcf_AnnotationSummary.html 

  - What chromosome was used as input?
  - How many genes overlapped with the variants?
  - Are synonymous or missense mutations more common?
